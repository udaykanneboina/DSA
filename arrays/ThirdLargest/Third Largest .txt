Third Largest

Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the third largest distinct element from the array.

If the third largest element does not exist, return -1.
Note:

The third largest element must be distinct from the largest and second largest elements.
Duplicate values should be counted only once.

Examples
Input:
arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output:
12
Explanation:
The largest element is 35, the second largest is 34, and the third largest is 12.

Input:
arr[] = [10, 5, 10, 8]
Output:
5
Explanation:
The distinct elements in descending order are 10, 8, 5. Hence, the third largest is 5.

Input:
arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output:
-1
Explanation:
There are fewer than three distinct elements, so the third largest element does not exist.

Constraints
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
